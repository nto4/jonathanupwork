<p>Opponents of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan are poorly placed to unseat him in the second round of elections, but they are not giving up hope.</p>
</div><p>The results left many opposition supporters despondent, but once they got over their disappointment, they rallied and looked for reasons to stay hopeful. Some expect supporters of a nationalist third party to vote against Mr. Erdoğan in the runoff, though that seems unlikely.</p><p>Others feel they have no choice but to be hopeful and organize for the second round, so fearful are they of the consequences of a victory for Mr. Erdoğan. Over the past decade, he has jailed critics, stifled the media, and banned anti-government protests in the name of national security.</p><p>For them, these elections are existential. “Right now, we are no longer fighting for an ideology, but for freedom, equality, our own future and life, where our fundamental rights are protected,” says Seda Gökçe, a documentary film producer.</p>
